# soft-body
Mass-and-spring model of a soft body using the basic forward Euler method to calculate the motion. Calculated in C++ and visualised with matplotlib in Python.

How to use: -- Compile and run "soft.cpp". You may wish to change the simulation parameters as described in the code comments. This will output a data file,
"soft_sim.dat".

-- Run "soft_plotter.py". This reads the data file and creates the video. NOTE: THE PROGRAM Ffmpeg MUST BE INSTALLED FOR THIS TO WORK. If you know some matplotlib you may want to change the code so that it outputs to a .gif, etc.
